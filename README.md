# Integrative-LED-Display


I’ll break down the code behind my INTERACTIVE LED WALL & CLOCK project powered by Arduino! Watch as I explain how the LED wall reacts to input, displays the time, and works interactively. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced Arduino enthusiast, you’ll find insights into how the code makes it all come together!

What you’ll learn:

-How to program an interactive LED display with Arduino
-The logic behind creating a digital clock with LEDs
-Coding techniques for controlling LED matrices
-Step-by-step explanation of the project’s code
